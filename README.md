# React
## Quickly

Just a quick little test app.

Download and point your browser to the `index.html` file. Type something into the text box and it will ping a testing api

Nothing too fancy, just trying to set something up to show

**NOTE**

- The api it pings is [jsonplaceholder.typicode.com](http://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/)
- The components should be broken out into their own files and imported
- Bootstrap was a quick addon just to get some styling added
